Hi, I'm Yu-Ting. I was born in Taiwan. I'm currently a third-year PhD student in mathematics at the University of Utah. I'm working with Christopher Hacon, and I'm interested in birational geometry in both characteristic 0 and positive characteristic. Before I came to the US, I got my bachelor degree in National Taiwan University in 2021.
