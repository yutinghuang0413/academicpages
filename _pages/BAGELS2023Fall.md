BAGELS (Best Algebraic Geometry Eating and Learning Seminar) is a students-running algebraic geometry seminar. We meet weekly and share our knowledge and research on algebraic geometry and related areas. You can give a talk about what you are studying, reading, or researching. 

During Fall 2023 semester, we meet on Thursdays from 3:30-4:30 in LCB 222.
